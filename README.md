# Exercise - Pair Programming Code Kata

## Code Kata
A code kata is a practice session for coding. The idea is to practice your skills and throw away the results, rather than coming up with a robust piece of production software.

The word kata is Japanese and is popular in martial arts, meaning "way".

In this session we would like you to do a code kata in pairs.

## Pair Programming
Pair programming is a widely used technique in software development. The idea is that two people share a single workstation, and take turns

- one at the keyboard, the "driver"
- one standing behind them telling them what to code, the "navigator"

Normally programmers swap roles every few minutes, literally swapping seats, and have a constant conversation about what they are doing and what to try next.

For this exercise, you will make use of Github, creating a Repo for your pair. At the half way mark the driver will save, push to the repo (one last time), and then the navigator will pull the repo down. Then you swap roles, the new driver shares their screen, and you carry on.

## The Task

**Money Problem**

Given a amount of money, return the number of bills/coins of each denomination required. Use the lowest possible total number of bills and coins.

For example, £5.47 requires:

    2 £2
    1 £1
    2 20p
    1 5p
    1 2p

**Roman Numerals**

If you finish the first problem, try this:

Given a number, convert it to Roman numerals.

For example, 148 is CXLVIII
